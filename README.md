# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Note: This project is created with Node version 16.16.0. While newer versions should not introduce any breaking changes, I do recommend running the App using version 16.

Instructions to run the application: <br>

1. Download the repo <br>
2. install dependencies: `npm install` <br>
3. run the application: `npm start`
